**An evaluation of the pollock *Gadus Chalcogrammus* restocking programme in South Korea**

*Kyuhan Kim, and Philipp Neubauer*

# Abstract

The Korea pollock fisheries collapsed in the late
1990s. The collapse has been hypothesised to be the result of environmental changes in Korean waters
or overexploitation of both juvenile and adult fish. With limited data
available for the stock, no reliable
scientific analysis is available to support either hypothesis.
To facilitate a stock rebuild, the South Korean government has been running a
pollock restocking programme since 2015, releasing about a few hundred
thousand of young-of-the-year pollock into open ocean every year.  The
release programme was initiated under the assumptions that (i)
overfishing was the major cause of the collapse, (ii) the pollock
stock in South Korean waters is self-sustaining, (iii) the decrease in
stock was barely affected by changes in the ocean environment. Whether
or not such assumptions are valid still remains unknown due to limited
knowledge on the stock. However, there has been no sign of stock recovery after the eight
years of running the release programme. This apparent lack of success
has raised significant concerns
about the effectiveness of the rebuilding project. The main
purpose of this study is to test rebuilding likelihoods for the stock
for alternative restocking rates. Because data on annual fishery yields of
juvenile and adult stocks were the only source of information
available for this analysis, we applied a stochastic stock reduction
analysis (SSRA), using a length-based age-structured model that we
developed for this study. The model conditioned on historical catch data to
derive probability distributions of stock trajectories. Given
simulated stock trajectories from SSRA, we tested several release
scenarios by projection to quantify impact of different release
numbers on stock rebuilding timeframes. We also considered a suit of
alternative models to incorporate both structural and parameter
uncertainties. The results of our analysis showed that the number of
fish that have been released is likely not large enough to rebuild the stock
within reasonable time-frames even under the most optimistic assumptions.
